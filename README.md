# Note Taking App with Vue 3 and Vite

This template serves as the starting point for developing a Note Taking App using Vue 3 with Vite. It leverages Vue 3's `<script setup>` Single File Components (SFCs) to streamline your development process. For more details on how to work with `<script setup>`, refer to the [script setup documentation](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup).

## Recommended IDE Setup

For the best development experience, we recommend the following IDE setup:

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** An excellent code editor with extensive support for Vue development.
- **Volar:** A powerful extension for VS Code that enhances your Vue development experience. It provides features like improved intellisense, type checking, and more.

To set up your development environment, make sure to install these extensions and configure your VS Code workspace accordingly. This setup will boost your productivity while working on your Vue 3 Note Taking App.
